Space Explorer: a DOTS project

The main focus of this study is on implementing DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack) and PCG (Procedural Content Generation). DOTS will optimise the performance of the game's environment and the star's data, while PCG will allow us to generate and keep track of various star properties such as location, colour, speed, and scale.
